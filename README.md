## Repositories

### ocproject5

While creating the blog I have developed a tiny framework to manage controller, routing, renderer, container, event, request, response, session, security, form validation, etc.

### pokemon-old

I have developed a game where we can catch pokemons, battle against another trainer or exchange pokemon with another user.
  
It was my first project. So today I may organise my classes / services differently. I don't refactor it because if I have to then I want to make something completely different for the front, the back and functionalities.
